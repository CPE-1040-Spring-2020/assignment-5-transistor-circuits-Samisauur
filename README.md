1. NPN transistor circuit
Voltage measurements (off):
Accross the resistor RC = 00V
At the collector (C) = 3.085V
At the base (B) = 00V
At the emitter (E) = 00V

Current measurements (off): 
i.The collector current IC = .001A
ii. The emitter current IE = .001A
iii. The base current IB = .004A

Voltage measurements (on):
Accross the resistor RC = 4.38V
At the collector (C) = 2.87V
At the base (B) = .713V
At the emitter (E) = 6.55mV

Current measurements (on)
The collector current IC = 6.31mA
The emitter current IE = 6.68mA 
The base current IB = 0.368mA

The relationship between the collector, emitter, and base is that the base is a small amount of energy that is given or removed by the switch, the emitter is the full power given, and the collector is what is holding most of the power.

2. PNP transistor circuit
